A. The title of the homework and the author names
Proj4: Gerp
By Ryo Shimada and Ian Ryan

B. The purpose of the program.

C. Acknowledgements ofr any help you received, including references to outside sources you consulted (though there is no need to list C++ references like cplusplus.com)

D. The files that you provided and a short description of what each file is and its purpose.

E. How to compile and run your program.

F. An "architectural overview," i.e., a description of how your various program modules relate. For example, the FSTree implementation keeps a pointer to the root DirNode.

G. An outline of the data structures and algorithms that you used. Given that this is a data structures class, you need to always discuss any data structures that you used and justify why you used them. For this assignment it is imperative that you explain your data structures and algorithms in detail, as it will help us understand your code since there is no single right way of completing this assignment.

H. Details and an explanation of how you tested the various parts of your classes an the program as a whole. You may reference the testing files that you submitted to aid in your explanation.'



Files:
stringProcessing.h is the linker file for stringProcessing.cpp.
main2.cpp acts as the main for stringProcessing.cpp.
stringProcessing.cpp acts as the implementation of stringProcessing.h and includes the stripNonAlphaNum() function.

FSTreeTraversal is the implementation for FSTree.h and includes the printAll() function.
main.cpp acts as the main for FSTreeTraversal.cpp.

Summary:
To run FSTreeTraversal.cpp, use the command "make traverse" followed by "./treeTraversal DIRECTORY".
To run stringProcessing.cpp, use the command "make stringMan", followed by "./stringMan".
